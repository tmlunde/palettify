This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we protect any information you submit to us, and how we use it. We may amend this policy from time to time by updating this page.

# What is Personal Data?
We collect information in a range of forms, including personal data. As used in this Policy, “personal data,” as defined in GDPR, includes any information which, either alone or in combination with other information, identifies you as an individual, including, for example, your name, postal address, email address and/or telephone number.

# What Information Does StormGeo Collect?
Personal data may be collected from you in various ways, for example:
1.	Information about your computer and your visits to and use of this website (including browser, IP address, general location as determined from an IP address and provided by the browser, the site from which you come, and the links followed when you leave our site). This information is collected through cookies, and is processed for statistical purposes and analyzed for management use in order to administer the website or improve our products and services.

We also use a marketing automation tool to track visitor activity on our websites. The activity is obtained to track and better understand visitors’ interests.

We base this on individual consent, as cookies need to be enabled in a visitor’s browser for us to process this data. You can at all times disable cookies in your browser. Please note that you may not be able to take full advantage of our website if you disable cookies.

The retention period for cookies is 90 days.
2.	When you register and voluntarily provide information in response to questionnaires, to download forms, or to register for newsletters (this includes your name, email address, and any other details asked for and which you provide), the retention period for this personal data is three years. We process this personal data to inform you about our events, services or products, or other related information that you have requested or that we think would be of interest to you.

We base our processing on your consent, and you may at all times withdraw your consent by sending an email to info@stormgeo.com with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject field or by clicking on an unsubscribe link in any of our email messages or newsletters.

In some cases, based on a visitor’s legitimate interest, we may communicate marketing messages, newsletters and details of our business that we think may be of interest to you by post, email or similar technology (you can inform us at any time if you no longer require marketing communications through the unsubscribe steps outlined above).
3.	When you conduct activities on our site (for example, downloading a whitepaper) we may collect your name and contact details, details of your subscription to our services, and other information transferred to us, including your address. We will only retain your personal data as long as is reasonably required for you to use our content, products and services unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example, for regulatory purposes). Generally, we base this processing on the agreement you are party to, and in some cases our legitimate interest to process your personal data.
4.	We sometimes use personal data (contact details) to contact you for marketing purposes. For example, if we receive your business card at an event. We base this processing on either your consent to do so, or our legitimate interests in contacting you as a representative of your business. We store contact information as long we think it is relevant for us to contact you.

# Your Rights Over Your Data
You have rights concerning your data privacy. You may at any time exercise these rights by sending us an email to info@stormgeo.com.
We will generally answer all requests within 30 days. If we are unable to grant your request within the 30 days, we will inform you about the delay with an explanation for the delay and answer within the following 30 days. The original 30-day period may be extended twice.
Your rights over your data are as follow:
1.	Right to access your own personal data. We will provide information on which personal data we process, how we do it and our legal basis for doing so.
2.	Rectification: You may demand that we correct personal data that is either incorrect or insufficient.
3.	Deletion: We delete your personal data on our own accord when we do not have a legal basis or a business purpose to process your personal data. You may at any time demand that we erase your personal data in accordance with GDPR. However, please note that if you use any of our services that require you to provide personal information, deleting our records may mean that you will need to resubmit it to continue using such services.
4.	Restrict our processing: You may require that we restrict our processing to only storing your personal data.
5.	Right to object: You may object to our processing, where we will delete your personal data unless we are able to demonstrate compelling and legitimate grounds for the processing.
Right to data portability: We will transfer your personal data in a machine-readable format to third parties upon your request if our processing is based on your consent or an agreement where you are a contracting party.

# Marketo Munchkin Cookie
We use third party marketing software from a company called Marketo to send our emails. We use cookies as part of tracking so we have information on email open rates, click-through rates, and activity on the website. For example, visitors can download marketing whitepapers from the site. We use Marketo cookies to see who does this and if they then visit other parts of our website. This cookie is set by Marketo. It allows a website to track visitor behavior on the sites on which the cookie is installed and to link a visitor to the recipient of an email marketing campaign, measuring a campaign’s effectiveness. Tracking is performed anonymously until visitors identify themselves by submitting a form.

# Security
The internet is not a secure medium. However, we take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of visitors’ personal information.
We have put in place various security procedures as set out in this policy. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized personnel have access to visitor information. We use secure server software (SSL) to encrypt any financial information we might receive, and our database is hosted in a secure data center. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use our best efforts to prevent this.

# Changes
We may make changes to this privacy policy from time to time. If we change our privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page and update the “Last Update” date at the top.
