## The timeline
The timeline is at the bottom of the page, both on mobile and desktop. With the forecast mode enabled, you can click a given date, and the weather situation of 12:00 UTC that day will be shown. Pressing the play button will show the forecast for the next hours and days, while pressing play again will set the playback to loop. At any time you can jump to a random time at the timeline. 

If you want to put the view in a "showroom" mode, you can press the double arrows to the right of the timeline which will hide the timeline, and only show the current date. 

The timeline has two different modes; *forecast* and *observation*. The *forecast mode* is used to show model generated forecasts. It will show the forecast for the next days, but also gives the ability to look at the blend between the model and forecasts for the previous day. The *observation mode* is used to show the situation now and the last hours, and is used for for example radar and satellite data. When selecting an observation parameter, the timeline will switch from *forecast mode* to *observation mode*.

## Seleciting what to show

In the upper left corner you find a hamburger menu, search and layer selector. The layer selector is organizaed to help you to understand, act on, and communicate weather insights to your business.  When building the menu, we have organized with this in mind; What makes a good map? How can we engage people with a map? How do you make a map that offers unexpected insights or even captivating beauty?

The most basic map, is a basemap showing coastlines, the ocean and your assets. On the *color* menu, you get the possibility to select up to two different weather layers with pre-defined color scales to visualize how weather impact your assets now, and in the coming days. The next thing you may want to add, is an *effect* layer. You can select one *effect* layer showing for example wind speed and direction, adding liveliness to your temperature map, or showing the motion of the sea. 

Next, you may want to show areas witch have been identified as high risk areas by our machine learning models, or by our experienced meterologists meterologists in the *Polygon* menu. This could for example be a hurricane track or areas with high risk of hailstorms. If you also want isolines of pressure onto the map, this can be selected under the *Lines* menu. We have also learned from weather presenters on TV, and have added a *Symbol* menu. The symbol menu will put weather symbols on top of the map. 

At last, we have the Custom info menu. Here you will find any custom non-weather features you would like to add. In the future, we will also let you upload your own spatial data, or let you connect to your business' GIS system to display that info together with the weather.
